function [WEIGHTS] = mWEIGHTING(CATEGORIES, TYPE)
% Calculate a matrix of weights to be used while calculating agreement
%
%   CATEGORIES is a numeric vector specifying the possible categories.
%
%   TYPE is a parameter specifying the weighting scheme to be used for
%   partial agreement. The three options are below:
%       'identity' is for unordered/nominal categories
%       'linear' is for ordered categories and is relatively strict
%       'quadratic' is for ordered categories and is relatively forgiving
%
%   WEIGHTS is a q-by-q numeric matrix where q is the number of elements in
%   the CATEGORIES vector. Each value in this matrix specifies the amount
%   of "partial credit" that should be awarded for one rater assigning an
%   object to category k and another rater assigning that object to
%   category l, where k and l index rows and columns of WEIGHTS.
%
%   Example usage: mWEIGHTING(1:5, 'linear')
